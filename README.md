# LangOCR
> Screen capture language content for quick dictionary look ups.

This is a prototype for LangOCR, a cross-platform OCR application for
quick dictionary look-ups during active immersion of non-selectable
text.

This program is designed in line with the methodologies of the
MIA. For more information, please check out the [MIA
Website](https://massimmersionapproach.com/).

## Goals and Considerations
At this moment, this application is a prototype. The architecture is
still being developed so the code is in a high level of flux.

This application is intended to supplement active immersion while
reading in the target
language. 

[Yomi-chan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/) and
applications like it are fantastic when the text is selectable, but
it's difficult to do the same when the text of the medium cannot be
selected. 

[Kanji-tomo](https://github.com/sakarika/kanjitomo-ocr) satisfied me
for a long time, but doesn't have a modular dictionary interface. I
also had to copy my sentence cards into anki by hand. 

This is where LangOCR comes in.

The goals of LangOCR are to do the following.

* Minimize time the user spends looking up entries in a dictionary
* Minimize time the user spends making N+1 sentence cards for Anki. 
* Utilize a flexible dictionary interface for cross-language
  translations (e.g. EN to JP and JP to JP Translations).
* Log frequency of the words the user comes across.
* Leverage the machine learning engine at the core of this application
  for various future applications.
* Create a low-load intensity architecture that can capture and decode
  text over time. This goal is targeted to capture from games that
  use text as it's main form of communication.
* This application is designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
* Implement a flexible 'rule set' so the user can control how LangOCR
  operates.

## Installation
This project makes use of the Conan package manager for C++. To find instructions to install it for your system, go here: https://conan.io/downloads.html.

As a first step, add the bincrafters remote for Conan:

``conan remote add  bincrafters https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan``

To install packages via Conan, use:
* ``conan install . --build=missing``
* If you have issues with linking to openjpeg on Linux Mint/Ubuntu, use:
    * ``conan install . --build=openjpeg``
* If there are still issues, check out this document on build policies: https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/mastering/policies.html
    * This is also an option that can be tried: ``conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default``
    * The nuclear approach to build all dependencies from source is ``conan install . --build``

To compile and link the project, use:

``conan build .``

## Notes
Inorder for this code to work, you must have a compositor running! You
will see a big black screen blocking your view. Windows, Mac, and most
Linux users will not see this issue. 

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, please and thank you! While the project is
in it's early stages, I ask that you contact me before tackling major
changes so the changes are in line with the architecture goals.

My speciality is in embedded C and networking programming
concepts. Programmers of all backgrounds are welcome, but this project
is missing programmers with a strong foundation in QT and Machine
Learning.
